# Snickers

A simple game of eating as much snicker's bar (25 to be exact) before you turned into a monster (in 60 seconds). Any person can play this game to past time

Logic:

There is a button which starts the game, both the timer and the prouction of snickers. 
There is a counter to keep track of all the snickers that have been eaten. 
Every single time you click the snickers it disappears and the counter increase by one.
If the time is out and the counter have not reach 25 snickers bar, you lose. You are now a monster.
If the time have not run out and you reach 25 snickers, you win.

The game currently is a work in progress but all the MVPs are up.
